# Citibike Data Analysis Project

## Summary
This project aims to analyze bike usage patterns in New York City using Citibike data from November and December. The main objective is to identify trends in bike usage, the popularity of stations, and trip durations. The analysis helps in understanding commuter behavior and optimizing bike distribution and maintenance.

## Objectives
- Provide clear and understandable visualizations of bike usage patterns in New York City.
- Help optimize bike distribution and maintenance based on usage trends.
- Implement filters to explore data by month and user type.

## Data Description
The dataset includes:
- **Citibike Data**: Contains historical data of bike trips, including start and end times, station names, trip durations, and user types. The dataset is publicly available from the Citibike website.

## Included Scripts
- **citi_bike_data_NY.ipynb**

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Instructions

### Getting Started
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Install necessary dependencies with:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas jupyter
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and execute the data cleaning notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook citi_bike_data_NY.ipynb
    ```

3. Download the required Citibike data files for November and December from the following links:
   - [202411-citibike-tripdata.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/202411-citibike-tripdata.zip)
   - [202412-citibike-tripdata.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/202412-citibike-tripdata.zip)

4. Create a main directory for the project, named "data," and inside it, create a subdirectory called "NY." Place the downloaded CSV files in the "NY" subdirectory.

5. Use the `citi_bike_data_NY.ipynb` notebook to clean the data. This process can be applied to any other Citibike data CSV files you choose to download. Just ensure that all the CSV files are placed in the "NY" subdirectory.

6. **Creating Visualizations**: Use the provided TWB file to create various types of data visualizations. Point the TWB file to the cleaned data file generated by the Jupyter notebook script.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Identifies and removes missing values, converts date columns, adjusts timestamps, calculates trip durations, and checks station coordinates.
- **Data Export**: Cleaned data is exported to a CSV file for further analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: The TWB file utilizes the cleaned data to create various visualizations, which can help in understanding the patterns and trends in the data.

## Ethical Considerations
The project uses publicly available data from Citibike. All data used is anonymous and does not contain personally identifiable information. The analysis aims to be accessible and understandable for a wide audience, promoting fair and ethical data usage.

## Data Sources
The Citibike data is publicly available and can be accessed from the Citibike website.
